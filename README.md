# ReactionTestGame
The Reaction Test game tests how fast the player reacts to a visual stimulus. 
It displays a circle or a square randomly colored, sized and placed on the screen. 
It collects the time in seconds that the player took to click on the shape 
and displays this time as well as the best time the player had so far.
